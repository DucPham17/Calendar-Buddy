# Calendar Buddy

Calendar Buddy is an application designed for people to manage their schedule and find free time with their friend.

## Motivation
There are many calendar apps out there on the market. But most of them do not provide a way to find free time between friends. Looking though schedules and having to compare them side by side to find time to hang out with your friends, when you have a packed schedule, for sure is a hassle for most people. So we decided to build a simple and easy to use calendar app that not only helps users to manage their schedule but also allow them to find free time between they and their friends within second.
